	<h1>Everything You Need to Know About the <br><span>BMW </span><span>M4!</span></h1>
	<p>The 2021 <span>BMW</span> <span>M4</span> features a number of radical design changes over the 2020 model. This version of <span>BMW</span>’s sporty coupe has a newly designed kidney-shaped grille, it’s larger than the previous model, and it has more tech features. The <span>M4</span> also offers all-wheel drive as an option for the first time. Take a look at everything you need to know about the 2021 <span>BMW</span> <span>M4</span> and consider the latest 2022 <span>BMW</span> <span>M4</span>.</p>
	<h2>The Exterior Design</h2>
	<p>The <span>M4</span> sits at the top of the <span>BMW</span> 4 Series model lineup. It’s available as the <span>M4</span> and the <span>M4</span> Competition. The standard <span>M4</span> comes with an adaptive M suspension, M compound brakes, M Servotronic steering, and M Dynamic Mode with 10-stage traction control. The <span>M4</span> Competition adds chrome exhaust tips and a transmission oil cooler. The initial release of the <span>M4</span> will be a coupe, while later in the model year, a convertible will arrive for the standard <span>M4</span> model.</p>
	<h2>The Power</h2>
	<p>Under the <span>M4</span>’s hood, you’ll find a twin-turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder gas engine. It generates 473 horsepower and delivers 406 pound-feet of torque. This is an increase of 48 horsepower over the previous model, but if you want even more, the Competition model has the same engine but bumps it up to generate 503 horsepower and get 479 pound-feet of torque. The regular <span>M4</span> comes with a six-speed manual transmission and rear-wheel drive, while the Competition has an eight-speed automatic and the rear-wheel-drive system.</p>
	<h2>The Cabin</h2>
	<p>When you sit in the <span>BMW</span><span>M4</span>, it will feel a lot like the regular 4 Series. Some of the upgrades you’ll get with the sportier <span>M4</span> include a red ignition, red driving mode buttons, and upgraded M Sport seats that have more bolstering on the sides. <span>BMW</span> will also offer carbon-fiber trim elements as an option, and you can also get carbon-fiber bucket seats that come with cutouts for multipoint racing seat belts.

		Standard features in the <span>M4</span> cabin include power-adjustable front seats, automatic climate control, and synthetic leather upholstery.
