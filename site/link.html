	<h1>Everything You Need to Know About the BMW M4!</h1>
	<p>The 2021 BMW M4 features a number of radical design changes over the 2020 model. This version of BMW’s sporty coupe has a newly designed kidney-shaped grille, it’s larger than the previous model, and it has more tech features. The M4 also offers all-wheel drive as an option for the first time. Take a look at everything you need to know about the 2021 BMW M4 and consider the latest 2022 BMW M4.</p>
	<h2>The Exterior Design</h2>
	<p>The M4 sits at the top of the BMW 4 Series model lineup. It’s available as the M4 and the M4 Competition. The standard M4 comes with an adaptive M suspension, M compound brakes, M Servotronic steering, and M Dynamic Mode with 10-stage traction control. The M4 Competition adds chrome exhaust tips and a transmission oil cooler. The initial release of the M4 will be a coupe, while later in the model year, a convertible will arrive for the standard M4 model.</p>
	<h2>The Power</h2>
	<p>Under the M4’s hood, you’ll find a twin-turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder gas engine. It generates 473 horsepower and delivers 406 pound-feet of torque. This is an increase of 48 horsepower over the previous model, but if you want even more, the Competition model has the same engine but bumps it up to generate 503 horsepower and get 479 pound-feet of torque. The regular M4 comes with a six-speed manual transmission and rear-wheel drive, while the Competition has an eight-speed automatic and the rear-wheel-drive system.</p>
	<h2>The Cabin</h2>
	<p>When you sit in the BMW M4, it will feel a lot like the regular 4 Series. Some of the upgrades you’ll get with the sportier M4 include a red ignition, red driving mode buttons, and upgraded M Sport seats that have more bolstering on the sides. BMW will also offer carbon-fiber trim elements as an option, and you can also get carbon-fiber bucket seats that come with cutouts for multipoint racing seat belts.

		Standard features in the M4 cabin include power-adjustable front seats, automatic climate control, and synthetic leather upholstery.

	<h2>The Technology Features</h2>
	<p>The 2021 M4 comes standard with BMW iDrive 7.0 infotainment system and an 8.8-inch touch-screen display. The newest version of iDrive is an excellent system with intuitive controls and an advanced voice recognition system to make hands-free driving even easier. It works with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and it has an integrated navigation system, along with M performance apps. </p>
	<h2>The Safety Features</h2>
	<p>The M4, just like the M Series lineup, comes standard with BMW Active Driving Assistant. This is a group of advanced safety systems that includes automatic high-beam headlights, a rearview camera, active blind-spot detection, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-departure warning, and active lane-keeping assist. It also includes forward-collision warning, pedestrian detection, and a low-speed automatic braking system. Adaptive cruise control is available for the M4 as an option.

		The 2021 BMW M4 might be a two-door coupe, but its long wheelbase provides a comfortable and spacious cabin. The new Competition model gains even more horsepower than the standard M4, and both have an updated interior design and some new tech features.
